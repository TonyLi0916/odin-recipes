This is part of The Odin Project, a free open-source online coding course that teaches full-stack web development. 

The [recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) project allows us to practice the basic HTML we have learned. Consisting of a page with links to my favorite recipes!
