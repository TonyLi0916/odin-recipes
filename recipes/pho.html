    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>What is Pho? It is a heady bowl of spiced broth with flat, tangly rice noodles,
        a featured protein topping of your choice, green onions, and herbs. 
        Diners get to personalize their pho noodle soup at the table by adding various kinds of condiments, herbs, 
        and sometimes bean sprouts too. It's a quintessential have-it-your-way dish.</p>
